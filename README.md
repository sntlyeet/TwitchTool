# TwitchTool - explanation
a tool designed by me to use .txt botlists as a moderator on twitch. Its basically an autotyper that uses a txt file as an input. 

# How to use:
 - use the setuptool.msi to install the application. It will show up like a normal program and you can find it under "recently added"
 - Run the Tool
 - use the button "open files" to select the lists you want to use. (Be careful and check the syntax of the lists manually before using!!!)
 - The Files you selected should show up below and can be removed by selecting them and clicking the button below
 - prepare your twitch chat. You will have 5 seconds to switch to your browser and click the chat to start typing
 - the program can allways be stopped by pressing ctrl+f1
 - The autotyper is now running with 300ms between each message. Enjoy!
